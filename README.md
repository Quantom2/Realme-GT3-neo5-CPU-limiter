# Realme-GT3-neo5-CPU-limiter
A Magisk/KSU bazed module to slow down your CPU to make your screen time better. Highly customizable

# Features
## Avabilive right now
- Can limit your Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 CPU Frequency to a set amount of freqencies you can set up
- Can change Governor of your CPU to more energy efficient Conservative or fully energy efficient Powersave
- Can disable up to 4 CPU cores to quickly turn down power consumption in cost of raw computing power
- Can store and re-enact current configuration on re-install and updates, so futureproof to possible updates

## Planned for future updates
- More flexible options for governors â€” choose for each cluster separately, not only for one of them. E.g. Powersave to BIG and PRIME and conservative to LITTLE to better energy efficient without huge perfomace hit, etc.
- Options to dynamicaly enable and disable cores on-the-go (in case you need computing power right now!), featuring by-hand (action button) and by-script options (they would be incompatible with each other)
- Compatibility with other devices, mybe in form of universal script. Also you can adapt module for your kernel, read README and respect license please.
